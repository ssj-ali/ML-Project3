Logistic regression in Sonar Dataset
The Sonar Dataset involves the prediction of whether or not an object is a mine or a rock given the strength of sonar returns at different angles.
It is a binary (2-class) classification problem. The number of observations for each class is not balanced. There are 200 observations with 60 input variables and 1 output variable. The variable names are as follows:
1. Sonar returns at different angles
2. ...
3. Class (M for mine and R for rock)
The baseline performance of predicting the most prevalent class is a classification accuracy of approximately 53%. Top results achieve a classification accuracy of approximately 88%.
I have applied Logistic Regression and obtained an accuracy of 83.5.
Then I have tested the model by predicting mine or rock for some random data uploaded as test1.csv
